Now, the changes that I believe can be improved are :
Consistent Color Scheme: Ensure a consistent color scheme across the application. I believe the color scheme can have a little bit more improvement. 

Whitespace Utilization: Give elements room to breathe and create a clean, organized layout. The middle component seems to give a feel of clutter. I think the design can be a little more compact.

Avatar Styling: Add a subtle shadow or border to avatars to make them stand out. This can provide a polished and modern look to the user profile images.

Card Shadows: I think the cards in the pop-up can be a bit more playful, maybe a reverse animation or something making them prompt out.
